```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Bonus opportunities

Be the first to complete **at least two** of the following tasks to earn a bonus:

1. **Provide JUnit-Based Validation of the Tasks**

    - **Description:** Develop comprehensive JUnit tests that validate each primary task end‑to‑end.
    - **JUnit Test:** Cover happy path and edge cases (404 custom error page content, `/time` JSON shape and headers). Add a property‑based test (e.g., jqwik) for date serialization constraints and verify both HTTP and HTTPS when SSL is enabled. Include a negative test demonstrating expected 4xx/5xx behavior. Add a deterministic time test by injecting a fixed `TimeProvider`. Target ≥80% line coverage for all controller/service classes.
    - **Goal:** Ensure that your implementation meets all requirements and behaves as expected under various scenarios.
    - **Benefit:** Demonstrates proficiency in test-driven development and reinforces code reliability.

2. **Use a Different Web Server Than Tomcat**

    - **Description:** Configure your Spring Boot application to use a web server other than the default Tomcat server, such as **Jetty** or **Undertow**.
    - **JUnit Test:** Add an integration test that boots with the alternative server, verifies it starts, keeps HTTP/2 working over SSL (check ALPN `h2`), and asserts the server implementation (e.g., via `ApplicationContext` or response headers) is Jetty/Undertow. Validate graceful shutdown and a bounded thread pool size via config. Capture and assert the server banner/header differs from Tomcat. Configure max header size and assert oversized requests are rejected with an appropriate status.
    - **Goal:** Gain experience with alternative embedded servers and understand their configurations.
    - **Benefit:** Enhances your ability to customize and optimize server environments for different use cases.

3. **Enable HTTP Response Compression**

    - **Description:** Configure your application to enable HTTP response compression (e.g., GZIP).
    - **JUnit Test:** Write tests with and without `Accept-Encoding: gzip` verifying `Content-Encoding: gzip` presence, and configure `server.compression` (min size and MIME types) so small responses are not compressed; assert both behaviors. Verify `Vary: Accept-Encoding` is present. Ensure streaming endpoints (e.g., `text/event-stream`) are excluded from compression. Assert `Content-Length` is omitted when compressed and present otherwise.
    - **Goal:** Improve application performance by reducing the size of data transmitted over the network.
    - **Benefit:** Demonstrates understanding of web performance optimization techniques.

4. **Implement Content Negotiation in `/time` Endpoint**

    - **Description:** Modify the `/time` endpoint to support content negotiation in JSON and XML (add Jackson XML module or equivalent). Add a vendor‑specific media type (e.g., `application/vnd.example.time+json`) for versioning, and define a sensible default when `Accept` is missing. Provide an explicit `produces` list on the controller method.
    - **JUnit Test:** Verify correct media type selection for JSON, XML, and vendor type; assert `406 Not Acceptable` for unsupported `Accept`. Validate the XML/JSON output against a schema (basic structural checks). Assert default content type when no `Accept` is provided and that `Content-Type` matches the negotiated media type.
    - **Goal:** Enhance the flexibility and interoperability of your API.
    - **Benefit:** Shows proficiency in building RESTful services that adhere to best practices.

5. **Enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Support**

    - **Description:** Configure CORS with explicit allowed origins, methods, headers, credentials, and max-age for the `/time` endpoint (or globally). Do not use wildcard `*` when credentials are allowed. Externalize allowed origins via configuration and vary them by profile.
    - **JUnit Test:** Test preflight `OPTIONS` and actual `GET` verifying `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers, including credentials behavior and that disallowed origins are rejected. Assert that configured origins are picked from properties at runtime and differ by profile.
    - **Goal:** Allow web applications from other domains to interact with your API.
    - **Benefit:** Essential for developing modern web applications that consume APIs from different origins.

6. **Replace `error.html` with `@ControllerAdvice`**

    - **Description:** Replace the static page with a global exception handler returning RFC 7807 `ProblemDetail` (or equivalent), mapping at least one custom domain exception with meaningful fields and localization via `MessageSource`. Handle `NoHandlerFoundException` and validation errors with distinct problem types; include `type` as a resolvable URI and `instance` as the request path.
    - **JUnit Test:** Verify status codes and JSON body shape for different exceptions; include a test that ensures a correlation/trace id is included (header and response) and localized `detail` based on `Accept-Language`. Assert `404` for unknown paths uses your problem format and that content negotiation returns XML when requested.
    - **Goal:** Achieve more flexible and centralized error handling.
    - **Benefit:** Enhances maintainability and provides a consistent error response structure.

7. **Implement Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation**

    - **Description:** Integrate Swagger UI into your application to auto-generate API documentation.
    - **JUnit Test:** Verify `/v3/api-docs` contains the `/time` schema and that Swagger UI is accessible; ensure the OpenAPI server URL reflects HTTPS when SSL is enabled. Add a security scheme (HTTP bearer) and an example for `/time` and assert they appear in the spec. Mark `/actuator` as hidden in the spec if exposed. Validate that vendor media type is documented with an example.
    - **Goal:** Improve API usability and provide a professional touch to your application.
    - **Benefit:** Improves API usability and provides a professional touch to your application.

8. **Implement Logging with SLF4J and Logback**

    - **Description:** Configure structured JSON logging (e.g., Logstash encoder), propagate a correlation id (e.g., `X-Request-Id`) via MDC across async boundaries, and set different log levels per profile. Mask sensitive headers/fields (e.g., `Authorization`) in logs and include request duration.
    - **JUnit Test:** Use a test appender to verify logs contain correlation id, endpoint path, JSON structure, and duration; assert level differences across profiles and that sensitive fields are masked.
    - **Goal:** Demonstrate your ability to implement effective logging strategies for monitoring and debugging.
    - **Benefit:** Shows your ability to implement effective logging strategies for monitoring and debugging.

9. **Use Profiles to Manage Configurations**

    - **Description:** Utilize Spring Boot profiles to manage different configurations (e.g., development, production).
    - **JUnit Test:** Provide tests using `@ActiveProfiles` for `dev` and `prod` asserting profile-specific properties (e.g., port, logging level), that a profile-scoped bean is selected, and that sensitive properties are loaded from environment variables without being hardcoded. Use `DynamicPropertySource` to supply test‑time overrides and confirm profile-specific OpenAPI server URLs.
    - **Goal:** Learn how to manage application settings across different environments.
    - **Benefit:** Enhances your application's flexibility and readiness for deployment in different environments.

10. **Automated HTTP/2 Verification**

    - **Description:** Add integration tests that verify HTTP/2 over SSL is used and that disabling HTTP/2 falls back to HTTP/1.1. Enforce TLS 1.3 with restricted ciphers for the HTTPS profile and set a strict `server.connection-timeout`. Expose a readiness probe endpoint and ensure it remains accessible over HTTP/2.
    - **JUnit Test:** Use Spring Boot Test with JDK `HttpClient` to assert `HTTP_2` when `server.http2.enabled=true` and `HTTP_1_1` when disabled; assert status `200` for `/time` in both cases. Additionally, verify ALPN `h2` is negotiated and that TLS 1.2 connections are rejected when 1.3 is enforced. Assert requests exceeding the connection timeout fail as expected and that the readiness probe works over HTTP/2.
    - **Goal:** Ensure HTTP/2 is correctly configured and verifiable in CI, not only via manual `curl` tests.
    - **Benefit:** Increases confidence that production transport features are enabled and tested automatically.
